    "In this weeks mini-workshop, we are going to supplement our understanding of Python by introducing some more advanced concepts and going over some practice problems. The practice problems at the end of the workshop will first introduce the problem and have an empty method signature for you to implmement the solution, and then show you a correct solution in both code and explained through text. We highly encourage you try to solve the practice problems yourself before peeking at the solutions. "

    "### Defining a class\n",
    "Python, like Java or C++,can be considered an object-oriented language. Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on designing code through defining objects within classes. Classes would contain data (stored values) and methods (blocks of code that can be called to do stuff). \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider defining a student class in Python. Which data and methods would we include? Perhaps we feel it is important for students to keep track of their grades, so we will create variables representing their GPA earned in each class. Also, let's say it is important for students to be able to produce a transcript. We will include a method which prints a transcript for the student based on their grades. If we want to calculate an average when producing the transcript, we can include a method for that, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the above class defined in Python. Let's look at the code first. Then, we will discuss the important steps in defining a class."

    "To create an instance (instantiate) this class, we call the name of the class `Student` as a function. This actually runs the function `__init__` that we defined earlier, called the constructor. One thing to note is that when calling the function we ignore the `self` argument. That stands for the object itself, and is included in all _instance methods_. The methods that don't take self as an argument by comparison are called _static methods_. We call instance methods by first writing an instance of our class (any variable of type `Student`), then a `.`, then the function name. To call static methods, we write the class name instead of the instance."
